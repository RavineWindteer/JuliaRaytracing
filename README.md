 Implementation of Ray Tracing in One Weekend in Julia

This repository is my attempt to adapt the C++ code presented in [Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) to Julia. The code structure is very similar to the one in the book.

To run, execute the file main.jl from this folder. This will automatically activate the JuliaRaytracing environment. The code depends on [PNGFile.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/PNGFiles.jl) for saving the render in the .png format.
